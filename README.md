# Optimizing-Network-Intrusion-Detection


This project depicts the use of ML classification algorithms on the UNSW-NB15 dataset, leading to the generation of a network intrusion detection model which classifies incoming traffic into malicious or non-malicious traffic and issues an alert to the user. It involves the implementation of the following ML Algorithms - Support Vector Machine, Artificial Neural Network and One-Class Support Vector Machine with an average accuracy of 89.25%, 91.54% and 93.05% respectively.
